Simple Web
==========

This is a super minimalist template to start a simple website that uses Node.js, Express, React, IcedCoffeeScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.

The goals are:

* Super simple to understand and build from
* Minimum boilerplate
* Only use common libraries
* Client side rendering
* Flexibility for adding anything
* CoffeeScript or IcedCoffeeScript for both server and client
